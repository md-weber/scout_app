# A app for a german association called "Digitalcafé Karlsruhe"

The idea is to collect here some digital ideas a app for the Digitalcafé Karlsruhe.

- [Digitalcafé Karlsruhe]()

## Ideas for this app

In this app I would like to contain all features of the website and maybe incorporate more features in the future.

## Roadmap

Create feature parity with the website

- [x] Main Page

If the app is feature parity with the website, some ideas what we could add in the future:

- [ ] Tutorials how to make different knots
- [ ] Introduce Members of the Team
- [ ] Accounts to manage achievements
- [ ] Planning Calender for the Leaders
- [ ] TBD

## Disclaimer

This is a personal app created by me and is not related so far with the association. It is a
proof of work and will be part of my personal portfolio. This can of course change in the future.
As soon I have a running product
